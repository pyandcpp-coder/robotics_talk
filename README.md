## Overview

The goal of this project was to move beyond traditional PowerPoints and create a memorable presentation that embodies the high-tech, futuristic nature of robotics. The site guides the audience through key concepts with a cinematic, scroll-based narrative, engaging them with motion and interactivity.

## Key Features

-   **Interactive Particle Background**: A dynamic, animated background powered by `react-tsparticles` that reacts to user interaction.
-   **3D Parallax Tilt Cards**: "Glassmorphism" cards built with `react-parallax-tilt` that create a sense of depth and respond to device orientation and mouse movement.
-   **Scroll-Driven Animations**: Content sections elegantly fade and slide into view as the user scrolls, orchestrated with `framer-motion`'s powerful animation library.
-   **Section Snap-Scrolling**: The viewport snaps to each section, creating a clean, focused, and presentation-like viewing experience.
-   **Fully Responsive Design**: A mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS ensures a flawless experience on all devices, from phones to desktops.
-   **Optimized Performance**: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering, code-splitting, and optimized asset loading.
